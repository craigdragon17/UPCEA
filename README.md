# UPCEA
UPCEA stands for Useful Popular Coding Examples Awesome!!

It means exactly that. These are coding examples that I have pulled from various sources. These include sources from Codepen, StackOverflow and many more. All I ask is that you take pieces of code from these examples for you projects that you source the original creater a described in the readme for the examples rootfolder. 

For those of you who are new. The rootfolder for each example will be identifiable based on the following format.
                              
                              Ex: Route-Example-1. 

Route is the type of example. Example is a placeholder stating its an example. The number one is the order in which someone has acquired the example. This format must be followed to maintain consistency.
